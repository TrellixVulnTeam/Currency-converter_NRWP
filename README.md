# About
## Currency Converter App

This is a currency converter app which is for portfolio and not for release or monetize.

# Why I created this App
I created this app to practice using fetch API.
Since I stay in Canada, I often use these kind of converters. Then sometimes feel uncomfortable to use it. I just thought if I could make one by myself, I can improve it for my own.

I also tried to make beautiful layout even for mobile friendly. You can enjoy this app both web browsers and mobile devices.

<!-- # UI Design
![UI](./design.png)

I created UI design with [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/).
I arranged UI design during developing so first image is a little bit different from others. There are two types of background, daytime and nighttime. Also it will be changed depend on the local weather. -->
